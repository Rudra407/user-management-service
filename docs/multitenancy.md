# Multitenancy Support

This document outlines the approach for implementing multitenancy in the User Management Service.

## Overview

Multitenancy allows the service to support multiple tenants (organizations or clients) while maintaining proper data isolation and security.

## Implementation Strategy

We will use a shared database with separate schemas approach, where:

1. Each tenant will have a unique identifier
2. The tenant context will be determined from the request headers
3. Data access will be restricted based on the tenant identifier
4. Configuration settings can be customized per tenant

## Security Considerations

- Data is isolated at the database level
- Authentication and authorization mechanisms ensure proper access control
- All tenant-specific data is encrypted
- Audit logging tracks actions per tenant

## Performance Optimization

- Connection pooling is configured per tenant
- Resource utilization is monitored and rate limited per tenant
- Caching strategies are implemented with tenant context awareness

## Future Enhancements

- Custom feature flags per tenant
- Enhanced analytics and monitoring
- Multi-region deployment options
